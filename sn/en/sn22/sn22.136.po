# Kukkula is a rare term, and there is little early evidence for its meaning. In Pali it appears here and in SN 10.5 where it is parallel to a hell. Elsewhere too it is the name of a hell, so perhaps we should simply use “hellish”. In Skt it has the sense of “chaff, burning chaff”, but this too seems thinly attested. Nevertheless, the sight of burning off chaff of rice and other crops was probably a common one, so I accept this. See https://static.squarespace.com/static/4f334481cb12c1acadc57623/5177e444e4b0244b5f673736/5177e4a0e4b0244b5f67cd57/1266225113983/1000w/4-1.jpg I can’t find any support for BB’s “hot embers”, though.
