# perhaps the original meaning of rana was “battlelust”. In Skt we find raṇajaya, and it a tempting reading here. But the consensus of the traditions is that in such contexts it means “defilement”. For the record, here is Edgerton BHSD: also raṇajaha m.c., (1) adj. (cf. raṇa; = Pali raṇaṃjaha), primarily abandoning impurities (so Tib. usually, ñon moṅs (pa) spoṅ ba, or spaṅs ba), but in some contexts, both in Pali and BHS, apparently understood as victorious in battle (Skt. raṇa), so that Trenckner (see PTSD. s.v.) wished to em. to raṇaṃjaya; once, at least, Tib. (on LV 304.19) renders thus, gyul las rgyal; Speyer on Av ii.131 note 3 suggests pacifier, peace-maker, but this is clearly inappropriate to the contexts; nor is Seidenstücker’s dem Kampfgewühl entronnen (see PTSD s.v.) any more plausible; the orig. and primary mg. seems certain in LV 358.2 (vs); 361.20 (vs, here raṇajaha, m.c.); 423.22; context tempts to assuming contamination with raṇa, battle (but it is hard for me to guess how, in that case, -jaha was interpreted) in LV 304.19 (vs; on Tib. see above) śūru (nom.) balavāṃś ca raṇaṃjahaś ca; LV 437.21 (vs) śūro mahā-raṇaṃjahaḥ; and possibly LV 116.12 (vs) jātī-jarā-maraṇa-kleśa-raṇaṃjahasya; in all these ep. of Buddha, or the Bodhi-sattva; (2) n. of a former Buddha: Sukh 5.18; (3) n. of a samādhi: Mvy 535 (Tib. as usual); ŚsP 1417.10.
