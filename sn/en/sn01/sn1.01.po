# BB has “not halting “and” not straining”, and other translators have rendered similarly. However I am not quite happy with such translations, as they never appear to make the metaphor clear. The point, it seems to me, is that when one stands in a flood, when the water gets too deep you sink over your head; and if you swim, you get swept away. Perhaps we have been misled by the connotations of “sink” in English; it doesn’t quite work to say that “if you stand, you sink”. Rather, it means “get submerged”.
