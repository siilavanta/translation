# I don’t understand this verse very well, and i can’t see how BB (and Woodward likewise) construe it. They take it that aganta is a synonym of anagami, and connect the infatuation with sensual pleasures as obstructing the attainment of non-return after death (?) This all seems very obscure to me. It seems to me that the deva may be expressing a pre-Buddhist view, where sinners go to hell, never to return. Or perhaps the idha is displaced, or should be duplicated, and the point is that having gone to the “realm of death” one does not return to this realm. punāgamana is not used very often, but at AN 7.62 it is used in a similar way, to say that one “does not return here”. I follow the latter interpretation, as it conforms to the Buddhist sense; if the deva was really expressing such a non-Buddhist view, you’d expect the Buddha to point it out.
