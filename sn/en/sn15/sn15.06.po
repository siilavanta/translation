# BB follows the comm in saying the city has iron walls. Not unreasonable, but it’s not what the text says. As for gulikabaddha, BB evidently reads culika and translates “dense as a topknot”, which doesn’t make much sense. PTS dict has “put together, kneaded, made into cakes (of meal )” as a meaning of baddha, and this is clearly preferable here.
