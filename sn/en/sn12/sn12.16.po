# Note that here bhikkhu can be read as either vocative or nominative. Given that such passages virtually always include a vocative, BB translates thus, taking the nominative as implied. Indeed, at the parallel passage in SN 35.155 the same phrase is punctuated as a vocative. However, at SN 12.67 we explicitly have “avuso, bhikkhu” i.e. the sentence takes bhikkhu as nominative. I suspect that when the text is addresed to “a bhikkhu” it resulted in a repeated “bhikkhu bhikkhu”, which came to be omitted as an error. Thus I take the syntax at SN 12.67 as correct, and insert the implied nominative.<a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>
