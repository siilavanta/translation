# BB evidently takes “nam” to be referring to the six senses; but of course it’s singular. Okay, it could be treating them as a group, but cp. SN 35.243, the only other place this idiom occurs. Here the “nam” refers back to the meditating monk. In this case, I think it’s best to take it as referring back to the “empty village”, which is just a metaphor for the same thing.
