# NOTE: The building in [](MS.1.1906), the _māḷa_, is hard to distinguish from the buildings mentioned in the next two paragraphs, the _pāsāda_ and the _hammiya_. In fact the commentary says they are all different types of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses,” see [](Sp.3.654.11). What all these buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings in [](MS.1.1901-1.1904), the _nivesana_ and the _udosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category. Rather than try, from a modern perspecitve, the probably futile task of naming each of these buildings, which in any case would not be very useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” For why a _pāsāda_ is a stilt house, see [ref. to internet page].
