# NOTE: I have rendered _sassāmikaṃ_ as “with a sponsoring owner.” The word _sāmika_ generally means “owner,” and there seems to be no reason why that should not also be the meaning here. However, although the monk does not own the dwelling, he is still the builder and the intended user once the building is finished. To indicate this, I have added the word “sponsoring.”
