# Nyanamoli/Bodhi’s “will have made themselves safe” is future perfect, which is rare in pali and seems to require the past participle. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-future-perfect-tense-in-pali/4630/7 Horner notes the problem without offering a solution. There are no parallels, and comm. and tika are silent. Not just the grammar, but the sense seems impossible. How can annihilation be safety? Normally the idiom attanam karoti is used as you would expect, when you find safety, i.e. survive. Anyway, how is the person actually doing anything? If there is no afterlife, that’s just how it is, they are not making themselves anything at all. I think the text is corrupt, and have no solution. Perhaps it originally meant something like: “If there is no other world, then, for all that this individual tries to keep themselves safe, still their body breaks up.” But I see no way to justify this on the current text.
