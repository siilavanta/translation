# Var readings vacisamhara, vacisamsara, vacisankhara: Comm: Vacīsaṃhāroti vacanasañcāro. Imehi kathitaṃ amūsaṃ antaraṃ paveseyya, tumhe imehi idañcidañca vuttāti amūhi kathitaṃ imesaṃ antaraṃ paveseyyāti attho, Tika: Vacanasañcāroti pesuññavasena aññathāvacanupasaṃhāro. The parallel passage is at AN 2.63, where samsara is the MS reading, and adopted by BB there. Comm there gives a completely different explanation: ubhato vacīsaṃsāroti dvīsupi pakkhesu aññamaññaṃ akkosanapaccakkosanavasena saṃsaramānā vācā vacīsaṃsāro. Tika has: Saṃsaramānāti pavattamānā. Despite this, I think the reading samhara makes better sense, as per MN comm.
