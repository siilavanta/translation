# Comm has “row” for cīra, which seems like a stretch. I can’t find it attested elsewhere in this sense. Skt dict acknowledges the sense row, line, but only in late sources, and I don’t know if it is relevant. BB renders it as “plantation”, evidently referring to the rows of trees in a plantation, though from the commentary’s description it sounds more like a decorative row or hedge. Normally it refers to strips of bark or cloth. At MN 12 we have the simile of a tindukakhanu (ebony trunk) flaking off bark (papatika). And at DN 24 we have the tindukakhāṇu-paribbājakārāmo. I suspect the usual meaning of cīra should apply, i.e. “park littered with strips of tinduka bark”, or perhaps even “the single hall, lined with strips of tinduka bark”. I am at a loss to explain the long ā in sandhi. In DN 24, perhaps also we might read “monastery built from tinduka stumps”. But tinduka is not usually used as a building material, nor is an arama a building. Regarding the numbers, the variants are 300 and 500, I have chosen the less common number.
