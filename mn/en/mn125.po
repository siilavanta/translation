# The parallel passage occurs at MN 125 and AN 2.38. MS text has kāmamajjhāvasati at AN 2.38 and kāmamajjhe vasanto at MN 125. BB has “living in the midst of sensual pleasures” at MN 125 and “dwells in sensual pleasures” at AN 2.38, with the note: “I follow Ce and Be kāmamajjhāvasati (= kāmaṃ ajjhāvasati), as against Ee kāmamajjhe vasati.” Notably, the first two terms in the sequence are reversed. the sequence in MN 125 makes better sense: it starts with where they live, what they do, what they think about, and gradually moves up to being consumed and seeking more. I take this as the correct sense and translate both passages accordingly.

# See note by BB, and Analayo’s discussion in Comparative Studies. Manuscripts, including Skt and Chinese, seem to vary between kayupasamhita … dhammupasamhita, and kamupasamhita. Evidently the entire passage is corrupt, and I don’t see that a definitive conclusion is attainable. It seems to me the simplest explanation of the situation in the Pali text is that the above fragment on giving up the five hindrances was accidentally added as part of the abbreviated gradual training section. With that removed, kamupasamhita becomes the more obvious reading here.
