# vuṭṭhānima is unclear. BB has “emergence from ripening”, Chalmers has “grew and grew” (evidently reading vuddhi), Horner does not translate. Comm. has vipākavuṭṭhānavedanaṃ “feeling that emerges as a result of kamma”, which evidently underlies BB’s rendering. Given, however that the only thing we know for sure is that he has just “come out” of the Great Hell into the annex, surely it is simplest to assume that the meaning has something to do with that?
