# Note how text in this passage varies the verb with upasampajja: pavedeti for Alara, viharati for Gotama. Chalmers, Warren, and Horner get this right, Bodhi and Thanissaro do not. In addition, BB has “in this way” for ettavata here, which is not very accurate. But see MN 79, where we have sacchikato hissa, bhante, ettāvatā ekantasukho loko hotī in a similar context. There he has, “at this point”. Surely the two passages should be translated consistently.
