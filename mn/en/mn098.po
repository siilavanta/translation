# Bhunjati at MN 98 must relate to the problematic yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha in MN 129, DN 17, and DN 26. Most translators there have, implausibly, “eat”. Here, Norman has “enjoy” while BB has “govern”. But the meaning probably is similar to the archaic English form “use”, in the legal sense of “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha means “use as has been used”, i.e. “don’t increase taxes”. That fits with the context, as this passage is all about ways people earn a living.
