# While supeyyam might seem to mean “sauce ingredients”, and is translated as “sauce materials” by BB, it is always used in the sense of “sauce”, eg at SN 47.8. The phrase tadupiyañca sūpeyyaṃ recurs at DN 17 and SN 22.96 where it must also refer to “sauce”. This means that the food that is sent is cooked food, not, as one might assume from the quantity, dry foodstuffs. This in turn supports the rejection of paṇḍupuṭaka in the sense of “rice in the sheaf”.
