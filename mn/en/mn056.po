# PTS edition has just nigantha here, which I follow. Curiously, neither MS nor PTS has any variants. However in the parallel passage at DN2, MS also has just nigantha, while in DN 25 it is just a tapassi. Note, though, that at SN 2.30 the catuyama is ascribed to Nigantha Nataputta himself. For the catuyama, see: https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-fourfold-restraint-of-the-jains/4154

# I’m not sure why BB reads “removing” for haraka. Why use ubbhata and haraka if they mean the same thing? I cannot find any references that justify PTS dict’s reading “removal” for this, i guess it is based on this passage, but elsewhere it seems to mean “carrier, deliverer” so far as i can see. But the real problem is that it ruins the metaphor. Mahavira didn’t want to blind Gotama: he thought he was already blind. He wanted to make him see properly, i.e. in line with Jainism. This simile is discussed at length in Analayo, Comparative Studies, but I do not find his arguments persuasive, as they end up making unclear metaphors.

# BB’s rendering “will give delight to fools” follows the comm., but I think it misses the point of the simile. When you dye a cloth with natural dye, it will initially look fine. But the cloth must be continually pounded for the dye to settle in, otherwise it washes out quickly. That’s the point of the simile with the monkey, you can dye it, but the color will soon wash out because it can’t be fixed properly. So it will only pass a trivial inspection. I can’t make the simile work literally, so I give an interpretative translation.

# The whole passage pivots on the ambiguity between vanna as “colour, beautiful feature” (cf. anekavanna= many colors in Kd 1), which clearly underlies the simile (cf. also the similes of flowers held together by thread at Pj 1), and vanna as “praise”. The Kadā saṃyūḷhā pana te idiom is used at DN 21 of gatha. I try to bring out these connections.
