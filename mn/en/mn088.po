# In certain contexts, (eg MN 38) paccagacchati seems to have its literal sense of “fall back on” in the sense of “revert to more primitive practices or beliefs”. However, this passage shows that the meaning is more idiomatic than this. We could, of course, read it differently in the different contexts. However it seems unlikely that it would have a more abstract meaning in a simple ordinary language context as here, and a more concrete, literal meaning in a philosophical context.

# The Chinese parallel at MA 214 supports the reading chatta, i.e. umbrella 繖https://suttacentral.net/lzh/ma214/49.238. BB translates the commentary when he says “sixteen hands”. But this is impossible as it stands. 16x8 spans is only big enough for one robe, maybe a little more (Cf. pacittiya 92, where the maximum robe is 9x6 spans) But Ananda is supposed to make a whole set of three robes from this. Either a different measure is in use, or else the mention of “three” is a later addition, and originally it was meant for one robe. However the Chinese also has “three”. Regarding the rendering of bahitika, I accept the commentary’s explanation that it means “imported”. It is an unusual term, apparently only occurring here, and, as international trade was still somewhat rare in the time of the Buddha—even cloth from Kasi was regarded as special—this gives a better reason for why it is so special. This being so, there is no reason to accept the PTS dict’s explanation as “that which keeps out”, i.e. cloak. A royal cloak would likely be highly fashioned and decorated, and difficult to adapt as a monk’s robe. It makes more sense if it is simply fine imported cloth.
