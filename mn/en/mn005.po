# Both MS and BB are unclear as to the speaker here. BB’s section 9 attibutes the proceeding phrases to sariputta. But surely the question is an interjection by Moggallana, as indicated by the punctuation in MS. However, to start a new speaker here, as MS does, is to suggest that this passage is spoken by Moggallana, which is surely incorrect. The close -ti in the previous segment must simply indicated a quoted term.
