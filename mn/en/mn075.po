# This passage is sometimes cited as evidence that Nibbana has a positive connotation, parallel to a positive sense of health. However the Pali does not support this. The word for “health”, arogya, is in fact in the negative, i.e. the absence of disease. Obviously nibbana here means the same thing, the “extinguishment” of disease. While we don’t use the exact same idiom, it makes sense in the context of the many places, including this sutta, where disease and defilements are said to be “fevers” that “burn” you up.
