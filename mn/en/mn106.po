# balalapana is found at Thig 5.2 of a beautiful body, and at SN 22.95 we have balalapini, where BB has “beguiler of fools” noting that the comm says this refers to vinnana, although this doesn’t seem completely certain. At Ja 421 we have of kama: Ahahā bālalapanā, “Oh, oh, the cries of fools.” I think this context gives a good idea, it means something like “cooed over by fools”, or in the case of lapini, clumsily: “causing fools to coo over it.”

# MS punctuation is incorrect. The idioms here are odd. The comm gives an extensive and implausible explanation, which begins by proposing that the sequence of the text be reversed! Etarahi vā āneñjaṃ samāpajjati. Paññāya vā adhimuccatīti ettha etarahi vā paññāya adhimuccati, āneñjaṃ vā samāpajjatīti evaṃ padaparivattanaṃ katvā attho veditabbo. The Chinese at MA 75 has 以慧為解 “liberated by wisdom”, which is surely a more persuasive reading. I suggest there was an old corruption from vimuccati to adhimuccati.
