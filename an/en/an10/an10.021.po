# BB has “the superior or inferior condition of the faculties …” following the comms. It’s not implausible, but it seems to me unnecessary, and a little programmatic. Surely spiritual faculties are not simply better or worse, but of different nature and character, and it is this that is seen. The term is indriya-paro-pariyatta “faculty-other-comprehended”. The last term = paricca, which is normally used in mind-reading contexts.
