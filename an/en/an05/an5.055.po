msgstr "When a woman walks, she occupies a man’s mind."

# BB translates and explains ugghatita based on the comm, but this seems implausible to me. A swollen corpse is precisely one of the things that does away with lust, not excites it. BB cites DOP in support, but the entry is no independent evidence: it merely refers to this very text and comm, and, in any case, questions this interpretation. The verses make it clear that the term is closely related to “dead”. Surely it makes sense for ugghatita to be a state between “crying” and “dead”, not something that happens after death. Ugghāṭeti and related forms can mean “hurt, injured”, and so I translate. Falling in love with a woman who is hurt or in need of rescue is an old trope: in fact a nun uses this very trick on Ananda.
