# Pettanika (vl. pettaṇika) occurs only here and at AN 6.17. In both cases it occurs as part of the same sequence, hence must have the same meaning. However it is treated differently in the two cases. Here it seems to go with “ratthika”, while at AN 6.17 they are two separate items in the list. BB has no note, but translates “country gentleman” here and “Royal official … favorite son” at AN 6.17. ( “Favorite son” is, in any case, unjustified.) AN 6.17 makes it clear that a position of authority is meant. I think ratthika means “appointed government official”, while pettanika means “hereditary official”.
