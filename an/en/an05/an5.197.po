# Initially I rejected BB’s forecaster here, as I thought this more like soothsaying than science. But in truth there is nothing about the passage itself that suggests this; it’s just as likely that these are simply people who observe the weather and make predictions for harvest, etc. For kamati in this sense, compare the stock phrase Lābhā te, gahapati, saṃ te, gahapati, yassa te gambhīre buddhavacane paññācakkhu kamati
