# The PTS edition (his “Ee” ) gives the same reading as the MS, but has the “gati” reading as a variant. Here BB repeats the previous sutta. He doesn’t comment, so it’s unclear if this is an oversight. If, however that reading is accepted, there is little reason to include the sutta as a separate text.
