# These terms are linguistically straightforward, but require care in interpretation. See BB’s notes, where he quotes Comm and Tika. The first three are obvious. Kallita has the notions of health, brightnesss, and fitness. Comm says “hāsetum”, and I think an important part of this is the notion of happiness as a characteristic of a healthy mind. The samadhigocara is satipatthana, i.e. the meditation subjects that you develop to get into samadhi. Gocara is generally a “support”. This is generally in line with Comm and Tika, but they are a bit vague. The only case where I disagree with Comm is abhinihara. They interpret this in terms of the later idea of making resolutions for samadhi. But if this is the case, why does it come at the end of the list? As the final factor, you’d expect it to deal with what comes after samadhi. And in fact the most common use of the term is exactly this: “So evaṃ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte … ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti”. There’s no reason to think it doesn’t have this same meaning here.
