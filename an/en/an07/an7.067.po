# BB’s explanation of ugga rajaputta (ugga-caste warriors) is based merely on one of several meanings supplied in sanskrit. It seems implausible to me that we should find a specific caste mentioned here, and that rajaputta should just disappear: why do we lose the word of clear meaning in favor of an obscurity? At DN 3 we find uggehi vā rājaññehi vā which shows that ugga should be taken as a distinct noun here. There, it is said to be someone who the king is consulting, along with “other kings”, so something like “warrior-chief” seems appropriate.
