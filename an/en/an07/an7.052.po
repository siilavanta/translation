# I don’t think BB’s “looking for rewards” is quite right for sannidhipekho. A reward is something that you get, but this refers to keeping what you’ve got. sannidhi means to store up, and as the next phrase makes clear, it means you’re not really giving so much as investing. I think this is a significant difference between this and the teaching on kamma.

# Curiously, the text does not specify the results of giving in the abbreviated versions. It skips up to rebirth in the Brahma realm for the last one. Presumably each grade of giving would get you one level higher in the celestial hierarchy. The numbers work out, but the logic is dubious. Is giving because it is good less virtuous than doing so because of wanting to follow the example of some Vedic seers? There’s no comment on this in Comm, BB, or Hare.
