# Abhisamacarika is a little tricky to translate. It’s more than “etiquette” and less than “proper conduct”. It is a technical term, found rarely in the EBTs, and should sound like it in translation. The Vinaya depicts thus: abhisamācārikāya sikkhāya sikkhāpetuṃ, ādibrahmacariyakāya sikkhāya vinetuṃ. In our sutta, too, the same contrast is made. Thus “abhi-” here must be in the sense of “extra” to the “fundamentals of the holy life”. This is contra the comms, which say eg “uttamo samācāro”, “higher conduct”. CPD doesn’t catch this meaning either.
