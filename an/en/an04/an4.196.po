# See BB’s note both here and at SN 2.30. Tapojiguccha is an idiom that refers to the various kinds of self-torture (see DN 25). Since both here and there it is taken as a single thing, i doubt if it should be resolved as a dvanda, although that’s by no means impossible. The key is the comm gloss “papajiguccha”. But this has to be understood in terms of the primitive idea of papa, as held by the Jains and others, not the ethical/psychological Buddhist notion. In primitive thought evil was a substance or entity that existed in the world in a quasi-physical sense. In the Jatakas it talks of washing evil off oneself, literally. The Greeks had the same notion: evil literally inhered in the “blood on the hands”. At MN 12 the bodhisatta’s practice of “jeguccha” is separated from tapo, and it means being careful not to tread on any insect, i.e. the Jain idea that even unintentional acts create “papa” which will cause suffering. So yes, it means “horror of evil”, but not horror of intentional evil in the Buddhist sense. The term sin, while strongly bound to its Abrahamin roots, is perhaps the only term in English that conveys something of this primitive, physical sense of evil.

# BB has “without a fruit-bud core” for akukkuccakajāta. It’s not supported by comm or CPD. Evidently he’s following the comm for SN 22.95, where it refers to a banana tree. But I don’t even know what structure “fruit-bud core” refers to. There are multiple readings in the various contexts, but given that it follows ujum navam, I think it’s safe to assume that it’s meant to be the same word. I think it’s also safe to assume it doesn’t refer to any specific botanical structure, as these are very different trees. Most likely the term is a pseudo-synonym of uju and nava, and this fits the etymology of akukkucca, “not-ill-made”.
