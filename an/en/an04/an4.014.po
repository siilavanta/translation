# BB’s “object of concentration” is wrong. A) samadhi isn’t concentration B) nimitta isn’t object C) samadhinimitta is elsewhere defined as satipatthana, and since the corpse meditations are part of satipatthana, it must have the same meaning here. Satipatthana is normally the seventh factor of the 8fold path, leading to the 8th factor, samadhi. A normal, in fact very common, meaning of nimitta is “cause, ground, basis”, a meaning that stems from “precursor” as in “dawn is the precursor of the sunrise”. That’s obviously the meaning here: the samadhinimitta is that which is the precursor or basis for samadhi, i.e. it’s the meditation (satipatthana) that you do to get into jhana.
