# For usseneti I follow CPD, this is the natural reading. For the last three factors I see a thematic continuity: one “fumes” from an internal heating, “is ignited” by some external cause, and “burns up” when these catch on. Surely we should trace sampajjhayati to jhayati2 here; the exact term doesn’t seem to occur elsewhere.
