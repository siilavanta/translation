# Compare this passage with AN 4.186. BB follows the comm in each case, giving completely different renderings for ummagga, even though it’s obviously the same meaning. Also, his rendering of abhinihara misses the point. He uses “formulates”, which is essentially identical with the next, “poses”, however abhinihara refers to your intention or purpose. What it means is that you see behind a person’s approach and understand where they’re going with it. Finally, he also follows the comm in distributing “panha” across the three terms, which is unnecessary.
