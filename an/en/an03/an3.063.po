# See BB’s note here. His reading “in such a state” is neither literal nor necessary, and results in the interpretive difficulties he discusses. The phrase evambhuta only seems to occur once elsewhere in the EBTs, at AN 4.11, where BB has not really translated it. However, there it would seem to refer to a monk “like this … “or” of such a sort …”, and so I translate it here.
