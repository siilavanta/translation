# Tittha is more likely to have its basic meaning of “ford”, i.e. “way to get across’, rather than BB’s” watering place “. And dhuman katta doesn’t mean” smoke out the shed “. I don” t even know if cows were kept in sheds at all, and this certainly doesn’t say that. It is a traditional Indian practice to burn cow dung, etc. to keep flies and other pests away from cattle. http://naturalfarmerskerala.com/control-flies-with-cow-dung-smoke/ Also, i use “satisfy” for pita; it’s less literal, but clarifies the simile later on.
