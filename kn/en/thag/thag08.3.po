# Compare the metaphor at MN 49. There, it seems to be an idiom that that true misfortune is one who "wards off Lady Luck". The point of this verse, then, is that one who, having found the Buddha, loses him, is like someone who beats of Lady Luck when she comes. Norman misses the connection with MN 49 and hence his suggestions are not cogent.
