# Pura is a rare poetic term for the body, see Norman's note. Apparently is the same PIE origin as "frame", for what it's worth. The idea is the body like an enclosed citadel, and "frame" is probably the closest. The -e endings here and in the closely related lines at Thag 20.1 are difficult to parse. Norman reads those here as accusative (probably plural) and in Thag 20.1 as either feminine vocative singular or locative. But I find it improbable that exactly the same forms in the same phrases should thus have two different readings. I take the forms as being feminine singular vocative throughout.
