# As pointed out by a series of translators (Neumann, Rhys Davids, Norms; see Norma's note), the name of this nun and the nature of the verses are problematic. Unlike the verses of the "thirty nuns" at Thig 5.11, these are throughout in singular and appear to be the story of just one nun. The Burmese reading, adopted as mainline in the MS edition, is likely to be a normalization derived from the commentary. Norman's suggestion that pancasata means "mindful of the five" is, however, unlikely. Given that Patacara was a famous teacher, I think the epithet pancasata simply means "having a following of 500".
